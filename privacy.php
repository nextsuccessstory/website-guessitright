                      GuessItRight joins the online industry in recognizing   that children, including young teens, may not be able to make informed choices   about personal information requested online. Accordingly, GuessItRight does not   knowingly target children younger than thirteen years of age for collection of   information online. GuessItRight does not solicit the collection of personal   information from children under the age of 13 or knowingly collect information   from children under the age of 13 without such child's parent or legal   guardian's consent.<BR>
                      <BR>
                      GuessItRight encourages parents to take an active   role in protecting the privacy and security of their children and to prevent the   inappropriate use of information about their children. GuessItRight also   supports the development of technologies that help parents control the   collection and use of personal information from children who use online services   in their households. <BR>
