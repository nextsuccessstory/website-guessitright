The Finalist will have the opportunity to randomly select one   (1) security sealed envelope and open the envelope. A Finalist opening the   envelope with the message: &#147;YOU WIN&#148; is the grand prize winner. 2) This   Certificate of Participation is limited to only one (1) grand prize winner. 3)   Grand Prize Promotions will be responsible for creating the envelopes. 4) The   Finalist will only select one (1) envelope. 5) Once the Finalists have been   selected the contest must be videotaped, which may not include any edits or   stoppages. 6) Two Sponsor representatives, age 18 years or older, will witness   the event. 7) In the event of a claim, the Sponsor will return all one hundred   (100) envelopes and videotape of contest to Grand Prize Promotions within a   period of three (3) business days.
