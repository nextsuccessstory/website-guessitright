Computerized Volvo logotype

An electronic version of the Volvo logotype is available on this diskette.  It is a 
mandatory requirement that you observe the rules below when using the Volvo logotype.

Fundamental rules

The Volvo logotype is a specially designed word picture whose graphic outline must be 
respected.  Every deviation harms the visual impact of the company’s communications 
and graphics identity. 

Consult the Volvo Corporate Identity Manual and Summary document for more 
information on the Volvo logotype and identity guidelines.

The logotype can easily be distorted in the computer by incorrect processing.  A logotype 
with incorrect proportions must never be inserted into any document.  Always observe 
proper scaling procedures.

It is the responsibility of every person working with computerized production of printed 
matter, in which a digitized Volvo logotype is included, to ensure that the final product is 
in agreement with previously approved repro art work.

If there is any suspicion that distortion has occurred, the imported logotype must be 
erased and a new original copied.

Installation

If you are uncertain whether you are allowed to make a personal installation or if you are 
uncertain how to install the logotype and typefaces correctly, contact your local support 
center.

Do not install the logotype directly from the diskette into your document.  Not only can 
the original copy be damaged, but there is also a risk of problems occurring during 
printing.  This is due to the image not always being copied physically into the document 
but through a link being created to the original.  In such a situation, the result will be 
unusable should you eject the diskette and print the document later.

Always copy the contents of the original diskette to the hard disk of the computer.

When you copy your document onto a diskette for printing or repro at another location, 
you must make sure you also supply a copy of the logotype on the same diskette.

Use

The logotype is created in vector graphics, which means it can be scaled infinitely 
without any loss in quality.  It can be assembled as an illustration in the actual document 
and scaled to size.  Modification must be in accordance with the set proportions.  If the 
proportions change, the logotype will have been corrupted.

The Volvo trademark must be used consistently and in accordance with the specified 
rules in the Volvo Corporate Identity Manual.  Ensure you always handle the logotype 
correctly when it concerns location, size, clear zone, colour, combinations of company 
names etc.

Always check the logotype on the final artwork before it is printed or duplicated. 
Compare it with the examples printed in the manual.

Format

The logotype is distributed in two versions, one for DOS/Windows and one for 
Macintosh.  System requirements and format of logotypes as follows:

System Requirements

System 6.0 or later	
	

EPS



All applications in Windows which support the EPS (Encapsulated Post Script) or WMF 
(Windows Metafile) formats, and all applications in the Macintosh which support EPS 
can thus use the logotype.

The logotype is distributed in a positive (black on white) version.  If you have a need for 
other styles e.g. blue or inversed, you should contact your Identity Manager of the 
appropriate operating sector.

Typefaces

On the diskette are also the corporate typefaces:
	Volvo Serif
	Volvo Sans

A third Volvo typeface, Volvo Broad, is for use as an advertising headline text, and is 
only distributed in a limited edition.

The Volvo typefaces are unique and have been specially designed for their legibility and 
distinctiveness in printed matter.

The fonts are distributed for DOS/Windows and Macintosh in a variety of weights.

Remember never to use the Volvo logotype in running text.  The Volvo name in running 
text should be reproduced in one of the approved corporate typefaces.
